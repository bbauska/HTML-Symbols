HTML Symbols – HTML Icon and Entity Code List
There are some characters that are symbols which you don’t get access to on keyboards. In HTML, 
these characters are called entities and are reserved characters.

For instance, there are cases when you might want to type the greater than (>) or lesser than 
(<) symbol while working on the HTML of a website.

If you type greater than as >, it'll be treated as a closing tag, and if you type lesser than 
as <, it'll be treated as an opening tag.

To type these characters, you have to use HTML entities. That’s why I have compiled a whole 
list of HTML entities approved by the W3C for you here.

## How to Use HTML Entities
To use the entities provided in this article, copy the entity name or HTML code of the entities 
and paste them directly into your HTML file.

If you are using the entity names, make sure they are preceded by an ampersand (&) and followed by 
a semicolon (;). For example, &gt; for the greater than symbol so you get > to create that symbol.

If you are using the HTML code to type in the entities, make sure they are preceded by an ampersand 
(&) and hash (#), and followed by a semicolon (;). For example, &#62; for the greater than symbol 
so you get > to create that symbol.

On some occasions, the browser might not recognize the entity names, so it’s better to go with the 
HTML code for that entity.
